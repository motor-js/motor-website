#### Context for accessing the Capability APIs

:::warning
Note, since v0.1.7 the Capability Context has been removed from the library. You can now access the Capability APIs by using the Engine Context.
Please see below for an example.
:::


## Usage

You can access the Capability APIs in any component in your React component tree, 
see below for an example which clears a field called <code>Date</code>


```js

import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { EngineContext } from '@motor-js/core'

const Example = () => {

  const { app } = useContext(EngineContext)

  const clear = () => {
    app.field('Date').clear()
  }
  
  // ...

```
